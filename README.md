# NSFreeResolutions
Macaulay2 functions for computing free resolutions of numerical semigroup algebras and checking
conjectures for the graded Betti numbers of such resolutions, with particular focus on
extra-generalized arithmetical numerical semigroups. This code is supplementary material to the
report [paper reference?] by Cho, Favazza, Jones, Joseph, and Macdonald.
